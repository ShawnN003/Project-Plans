## Project Overview

*** Challenger Archive ***

- **Problem Statement:** In an individual sport (or one on one) it forces you to focus, adapt, and remember aspects of your opponent and their unique style of how they play the game. The longer you play the game the more oppenents you are forced to memorize and at some point it becomes a hassle trying to remember what someone you played against weeks/months/years ago. This website gives the user the opportunity to record aspects of their opponents physicality, styles, and attributes as their own personal record to improve in the future.   

- **Target Users:** Pool players, MMA fighters, Fencers (maybe)




## Feature Breakdown
- **MVP Features:** Core functionality we could implement are giving the user two options for sports they play between pool and mma and some form of a user login to a unique database for each user to record their specifc opponents

- **Extended Features:** Some additional features could be adding different sports such as fencing, tennis, gymnastics etc. Also adding features like adding video of a previous game you've played against them to see how you can improve your own flaws.
